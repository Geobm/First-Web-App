### HackFCFM 2017 QComida App 

This repository is the outcome from a web application coded in [HackFCFM 2017](http://www.fcfm.uanl.mx/es/hack-fcfm-2017) (Ranked 3rd place winners among 13 teams). It contains the back-end in ```/src``` and front-end as well in ```/web``` directories respectively.

The main goal of the app is to help college students from the [Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon, Mexico](https://www.uanl.mx/) to look into food menues for some stalls and cafeterias inside the campus. 

As well to deploy special offers and food promotions of different cafeterias at the university through the web app.

To code the front-end, only HTML and CSS was used.

As for the back-end, Jakarta Servlets (formerly Java Servlets) was used. Hence, to implement a Java software component that extends the capabilities of a server.

 
### App architecture 

![Servlet](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Untitled-Diagram-14-300x225.png)

Servlets were used to handle the request obtained from the web server, process the request, produce the response, then send response back to the web server.

Feel free to edit the code.
